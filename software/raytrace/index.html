							<b>Overview</b><br />
                            <br />
                            This program implements rendering of spheres and polygons, recursive
                            reflections, refraction within transparent objects, texture mapping, antialiasing,
                            and depth of field blurring.<br />
                            <br />
                            A <b>world</b> object contains linked lists to objects, lights, and all
                            other information. All variable information about the scene is read from
                            an input file, including both a physical description and information about
                            how to render the scene (depth of field, antialiasing, shadows, etc).
                            Once all the data structures are set up, the main loop is called - <b>calcImage</b>
                            (outlined below). the returned image object, which contains an array of
                            all pixels is written to disk in the TARGA format.<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Platform and Compiler</b><br />
                            <br />
                            This code was developed in Microsoft Visual C++ compiler on a PC with
                            windows 95.<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <h2><b>Primary Functions</b></h2>
                            <br />
                            <b>calcImage()</b><br />
                            <br />
                            The main loop casts rays from the camera to each
                            cell in the view window. Each cell represents a pixel in the final image.
                            Multiple rays may be cast through each pixel for antialiasing or depth
                            of field blurring (these techniques are outlined below). Once a ray is
                            created from the camera to a cell, the ray is sent to a recursive <b>Trace</b>
                            function (outlined below). Trace returns a vector in color space with
                            values for R G and B channels for a pixel that corresponds to the cell through
                            which we traced the initial ray. The pixel is copied into a pixel buffer
                            object (an array of all pixels). Once rays have been traced for all cells
                            in the view window, the function returns the pixel buffer object.<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Trace()</b><br />
                            <br />
                            Trace sends the ray to a <b>findClosestIntersection</b> function (outlined
                            below), which returns an intersection object. The intersection object
                            contains the coordinates of the intersection, a normal (to intersected
                            surface) vector, and a unit vector that points from the intersection
                            point to the camera. The intersection object is sent to <b>calcIntensity</b>
                            function (outlined below), which calculates the local illumination of
                            the point (the illumination due only to light hitting the point directly
                            from a light source). Next, the intersected object is checked for transparency.
                            If it is transparent, a new ray is calculated, based on the angle at
                            which the ray hits the object surface and the index of refraction of
                            the object. The Formula used is as follows:<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>calculate refracted ray</b><br />
                            r= the object's index of refraction<br />
                            <br />
                            get the angle at which the ray hits the object surface<br />
                            c1 = dot product of n and v (n is the normal to object surface at
                            intersection, v is the unit vector from the intersection point to
                            the viewpoint)<br />
                            c2 = sqrt( 1 - (1/n)&sup2; * (1 - (c1)&sup2;) )<br />
                            <br />
                            the new vector will be -1/r * (v + (1/r*c1 - c2) * n<br />
                            move this new vector to the intersection point.<br />
                            <br />
                            Trace calls itself on this new ray, sending along a flag indicating
                            that the ray is inside an object. The flag tells trace that when it
                            finds an intersection (with the other side of the object), to refract
                            the ray back (the opposite of the refraction when the ray entered the
                            object from space). If trace receives this flag, it just calculates
                            a new ray out of the object and calls itself on this new ray. (it does
                            this using the formula above, but uses the inverse of the index of refraction)
                            It doesn't calculate any local illumination for that intersection point.
                            All the illumination will come from the next objet the ray hits. Next
                            trace checks to make sure the maximum number of recursions (maximum
                            reflection depth) has not been reached for this ray, and if not, calculates
                            a reflected ray as follows:<br />
                            <br />
                            <b>calculate reflected ray</b><br />
                            n = normal to object surface at intersection<br />
                            v = unit vector from intersection point to view<br />
                            p = coordinate of intersection<br />
                            <br />
                            new ray = 2n*(n dot v) - v + p<br />
                            <br />
                            Trace calls itself on this new ray. The values calculated due to reflection,
                            refraction and local illumination are weighted by the opacity of the
                            object. Finally, the values returned from any calls trace makes to itself
                            are added to the local illumination that <b>calcIntensity</b> returned,
                            and this final sum is returned.<br />

                            <br />
                            findClosestIntersection takes a ray and loops through all objects,
                            finds intersections with these objects, and saves the closest intersection
                            (to camera) that it's found so far as it goes along. The intersection
                            object contains the coordinates of the intersection, a normal (to intersected
                            surface) vector, a unit vector that points from the intersection point
                            to the camera, a pointer to the intersected object, and the parametric
                            coordinate of the intersection along the ray. <br />

                            another cell is chosen, and this continues until a cell is chosen that 
                            lies in a column that doesn't already contain any used cells. At the 
                            end, each column will contain only 1 sampled cell. This method insures 
                            that the supersampled pixels are random, but at the same time sufficiently 
                            spread out so as to get values from the whole area of the pixel and 
                            create a more accurate average of the whole intensity of the pixel.<br />

                            <b>Shallow Focus</b><br />
                            <br />
                            Accomplished by applying jitter to the position 
                            of the camera. The pin hole camera that is implemented normally has 
                            no focal length (it is focused at all distances) because it is not a 
                            lens that causes light that travels through it to converge at a certain 
                            distance. To simulate a lens, we use the same principal as for antialiasing: 
                            take the average of a finite number of random samples. In this case, 
                            we want to use a gaussian (normally) distributed random variable. This 
                            causes the number of samples taken to be much greater closer to the 
                            actual camera position, and less and less the farther away you get. 
                            This should provide realistic object blurring effects (the object gets 
                            fainter at pixels farther away from it's actually pinhole camera extent).<br />
                            <br />
                            To generate a random variable with normal distribution, we take the 
                            average of a number of instances of a random variable with uniform distribution. 
                            Assuming that d is our random variable with normal distribution, we 
                            can calculate jittered position of a lens sample on a circle (we want 
                            uniform distribution of direction away from camera point, normal distribution 
                            of length):<br />
                            <br />
                            assume the camera is aimed strait down the z axis<br />
                            n = random variable with normal distribution, ranging from -1 to 1, 
                            centered on 0<br />
                            r = radius of lens<br />
                            <br />
                            dx and dy displacements along x and y axes<br />
                            dx = n*r<br />
                            dy = dy*( sqrt( r&sup2; - (dx)&sup2; ) )<br />
                            <br />
                            these values are added to the camera position, and that position is 
                            used as the camera position for that sample<br />
